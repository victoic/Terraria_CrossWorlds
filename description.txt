Cross Worlds is a world sychronization mod, our objective is to unify worlds as a multiverse.
Right now synchronized worlds share Moon Phase and Time of day, so you can leave one world anc go to another and time continues where you stopped!
Only selected worlds are synchronized. To sync a world go to mod menu and set the "Sync this World?" option to On. That's it.
Do this to all worlds you want and they are synced. Have fun!
